# Diabetes-Machine-Learning
Implementation Of Machine Learning Algorithms On Diabetes Data

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Python3 and Requisite Libraries such As Pandas,Numpy and Matplotlib

Once you install python3, the method of installing the libraries becomes simpler.

Python3 installation by default gives you pip3 a tool which helps in easier installation of other libraries needed for the project.

pip3 install numpy.
pip3 install pandas.
pip3 install matplotlib.

Files Included
The Project once downloaded will contain the following folders.
DT folder:
	DT.py
	1-diabetes.csv
NB folder:
	NB.py
	1-diabetes.csv
SVM folder:
	SVM.py
	TestDiabetes.csv
Installing:
Install Python3 globally throughout your system either on MacOS or Windows 7/8/10.
Download All The Files.
Navigate To The Directory containing the Folders
All The Three Algorithms have their own folders, we have made in that way so for ease of use.
Execute them all in the terminal.(if you have a preferred IDE, you can choose that also, just make sure that the .csv file and the code file are in the same directory if you are using a IDE).

Example for running the code: python3 NB.py or python3 DT.py or python3 SVM.py in their respective directories.
Built With
